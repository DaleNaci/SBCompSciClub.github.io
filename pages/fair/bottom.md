# Welcome to the Computer Science Club
## Join Us
Join the Computer Science Club and learn JavaScript, the programming language that runs the web! Explore your creative nature by designing and programming interactive websites from the ground up, and learn the beauty of the open source community. Expand your programming skills and learn the basics of applications development applicable to any other computer science related course or project. _All while gaining career and college readiness!_

In this club, you will be exposed to cutting edge code and various programming utilities that drives the world today. Through JavaScript, you will inherently learn many programming concepts that you never dreamed of! The best part is that JavaScript's simplistic syntax makes it easy to pick up, no matter what (even if you have no programming background)! Why not give it a try?

## The 21st Century
Programmers from all around the world encourage collaboration. Almost every single application on your phone started out as a simple idea. That idea flourished into the final product youâ€™re so used to, not by one developer, but by many diverse people working together to build something awesome. And it all comes down to one thing.

The internet itself harbors one of the most innovative communities that strives to change the world: the open source world. All those questions that need answering are explained by physical strangers but virtual pioneers.

So why not learn JavaScript for the web, through the web?

## What about Python?
As we spent the last two years exploring Python, we decided to change the game a little this year by switching over to JavaScript. But don't worry! You can still explore Python through the year by writing simple scripts here and there that deal with the backend, server side processes. Server side python scripts have the power to display frontend websites to the user, enriching your web development experience.
